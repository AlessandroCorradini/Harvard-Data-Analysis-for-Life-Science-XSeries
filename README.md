# Harvard Data Analysis for Life Science XSeries

<br/>

## Overview
[Harvard Data Analysis for Life Science XSeries](https://www.edx.org/xseries/data-analysis-life-sciences) is an introductory learning and career oriented learning path for the Data Analysis world.  

The entire program is taught by the famous Prof. of Biostatistics Rafael Irizarry from Harvard University through [edX platform](https://www.edx.org).

This course cover:

- Basic statistical concepts and R programming skills necessary for analyzing data in the life sciences
- The underlying mathematical basics of linear models useful for data analysis in the life sciences
- The techniques commonly used to perform statistical inference on high throughput data
- Several techniques that are widely used in the analysis of high-dimensional data
