# Introduction

The concept of distance can be generalized from  physical distance. For example, we cluster animals into groups. When we do this, we put animals that "close" in the same group:

<img src="figs/animals.png" align="middle" width=400>

Any time we cluster individuals into separate groups we are, explicitely or implicitely computing a distance. 

Do create _heatmaps_ a distance is computed explicitely. Heatmaps are widely used in genomics and other highthroughput fields:

</font>

In these plots the measurements, which are stored ina matrix, are represented with colors after the columns and rows have been clustered. Here we will learn the necessary mathematics and computing skill to understand and create heatmaps. We start by reviewing the mathematical definition of distance. 


# Euclidean Distance

As a review, let's define the distance between two points, $A$ and $B$, on a cartesian plane.

```{r,echo=FALSE,fig.align='center',fig.height=4}
library(rafalib)
mypar(1,1)
plot(c(0,1,1),c(0,0,1),pch=16,cex=2,xaxt="n",yaxt="n",xlab="",ylab="",bty="n",xlim=c(-0.25,1.25),ylim=c(-0.25,1.25))
lines(c(0,1,1,0),c(0,0,1,0))
text(0,.2,expression(paste('(A'[x]*',A'[y]*')')),cex=1.5)
text(1,1.2,expression(paste('(B'[x]*',B'[y]*')')),cex=1.5)
text(-0.1,0,"A",cex=2)
text(1.1,1,"B",cex=2)
```

The euclidean distance between A and B is simply

$$\sqrt{ (A_x-B_x)^2 + (A_y-B_y)^2}$$

# High dimensional Data

In this chapter we focus on high-dimensional data. We introduce a data set with gene expression measurements for 22215 genes from 189 samples. The R ojects can be downloaded like this:

```{r}
library(devtools)
install_github("genomicsclass/tissuesGeneExpression")
```

The data represent RNA expression levels for eight tissues, each with several individuals.

First 10 rows and five columns of gene expression matrix

```{r,echo=FALSE}
library(tissuesGeneExpression)
data(tissuesGeneExpression)
table(tisse)
```

# Distance in high dimensions
===

We are interested in describing distance in the context of this dataset. We might also be interested in finding genes that _behave similarly_ across samples.

To define distance we need to know what points are since distance is computed between points. With high dimensional data, points are no longer on the cartesian plan. Instead they are in higher dimensions. For exampe, sample $i$ is defined by the point in 22215 dimesions $(Y_{1,i},\dots,Y_{22215,i})'$. Feature $g$ feature $g$ is defined by the point in 189 dimensions $(Y_{g,189},\dots,Y_{g,189})'$

Once we define points, the Euclidean distance is defined in a very similar way as it is defined for two dimensions. For example, the  distance between two samples $i$ and $j$ is

$$
d(i,j) = \sqrt{ \sum_{g=1}^{22215} (Y_{g,i}-Y_{g,j })^2 }
$$

and the distance between two features $h$ and $g$ as:
$$
d(h,g) = \sqrt{ \sum_{i=1}^{189} (Y_{h,i}-Y_{g,i})^2 }
$$



# Distance with Matrix Algebra

The distance between samples i and j can be written as


$$ d(i,j) = (\mathbf{Y}_i - \mathbf{Y}_j)^\top(\mathbf{Y}_i - \mathbf{Y}_j)$$

With $\mathbf{Y}_i$ and $\mathbf{Y}_j$ coliumns $i$ and $j$



$$
d(h,i) = \sqrt{ \sum_{j=1}^{N} (X_{h,j}-X_{i,j})^2 }
$$

Here are some data
```{r}
library(dagdata)
data(tissuesGeneExpression)
##show matrix
mat=e[870:880,14:19]
colnames(mat)<-tissue[14:19]
round(mat,1)
```


Let's compute distance
```{r}
d <- dist(t(e)) ##important to take transpose
dim(d)
```
Note that this gives us 17,766 distances, one for each pair. With these distances in place we are now in a position to _cluster_ samples that are close to each other. There are many ways to do this. One of the most used is [hierarchichal clustering](#foot). There are two main types of hierarchichal clustering: 1) top-down or divisive and 2) bottom-up or agglomerative. Both approaches require us to define a distance between two groups of samples, as opposed to two samples. This will permit us to _link_ two groups. The hclust function provides several options, but all of them depend on the distance between each pair of samples. With these definition in place, the agglomerative approach starts by defining each sample a group. The in each step it decides what two groups are the _closest_ and puts them together. This creates a "hierarchy" of groupings. Here we use the default.

```{r}
h <- hclust(d)
```

A dendrogram is a convient way of displaying these groupings. We start at the top with all the samples together and then add splits at the distance (shown in y-axis) were they were separated

```{r}
library(rafalib)
mypar()
myplclust(h,labels=tissue,lab.col=as.fumeric(tissue))
abline(h=120,lty=2)
```
Note we can also cluster genes. We compute the distance by compunting 
$$
d(j,k) = \sqrt{ \sum_{j=1}^{22,215} (X_{i,j}-X_{i,k})^2 }
$$


Note that in this particular example, a more make more sense to define the distance using the average profiles of each tissue. 

## Heatmaps
We are now ready to create heatmaps

We can't show all 20,000+ genes so we will select the genes that must change across tissue types.


```{r}
library(matrixStats)
sds <- rowSds(e)
ind <- order(sds,decreasing=TRUE)[1:200]
heatmap(e[ind,],scale="none",col=brewer.pal(9,"Blues"),ColSideColors=palette()[as.fumeric(tissue)],labCol=tissue,margin=c(4,0))
```


## MDS

[Multidimensional scaling](#foot) is another technique for reducing the dimensionality of the data, in a way that tries to preserve the inter-sample distances.

```{r}
mds <- cmdscale(d)
cols<-as.factor(tissue)
plot(mds[,1],mds[,2],bg=as.numeric(cols),pch=21)
legend("topright",levels(cols),col=seq(along=cols),pch=16)
```


## Some math

Say we standardize vectors $X$ and $Y$ and then compute the distance. We will compute the square for better illustration. 
$$
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{1}{M}\sum_{i=1}^M \left(\frac{X_i - \bar{X}}{s_X} -  \frac{Y_i - \bar{Y}}{s_Y} \right)^2 &=&
\frac{1}{M} \sum_{i=1}^M \left(\frac{X_i - \bar{X}}{s_X}\right)^2 +  \frac{1}{M} \sum_{i=1}^M \left(\frac{Y_i - \bar{Y}}{s_Y} \right)^2 - \frac{2}{M} \sum_{i=1}^M \left(\frac{X_i - \bar{X}}{s_X}\right)\left(\frac{Y_i - \bar{Y}}{s_Y}\right)\\
&=&2(1-r)
\end{eqnarray}
$$
with $r$ the correlation.

Difference in the average can drive the different. For this particular demonstration let's assume that $s_X=s_Y=1$. 

$$
\frac{1}{M}\sum_{i=1}^M (X_i - Y_i)^2 = \frac{1}{M}\sum_{i=1}^M \left( (X_i - \bar{X}) - (Y_i-\bar{Y}) - (\bar{X}-\bar{Y})\right)^2 
$$

$$
= \frac{1}{M}\sum_{i=1}^M \left( (X_i - \bar{X}) - (Y_i-\bar{Y})\right)^2 - 2(\bar{X}-\bar{Y}) \frac{1}{M}\sum_{i=1}^M \left( (X_i - \bar{X}) - (Y_i-\bar{Y})\right) + \frac{1}{M}\sum_{i=1}^M (\bar{X}-\bar{Y}) ^2
$$

$$
= 2(1-r) + \frac{1}{M}\sum_{i=1}^M (\bar{X}-\bar{Y}) ^2 
$$

$$
= 2(1-r) + (\bar{X}-\bar{Y}) ^2
$$

## K-means algorithm

The idea behind this agorithm is simple. You pick the number of clusters $K$ that you think are present. Then $K$ points are selected at random and defined as group centers. In a next step each point is assigned to a group based on the shortest distance. After this step the centers are recalculated based on means for each dimension (these are called centroids). The process is repated untile the mean cetners don't move anymore. 

```{r}
set.seed(1)
N=150
centers <- rbind(c(-2,0),c(0,1),c(2,0))  
dat<-t(sapply(sample(3,N,replace=TRUE),function(i)  centers[i,]+rnorm(2,0,0.3)))
centroids <- dat[sample(N,3),]
delta <- Inf
count<-0
# library(animation)
# saveGIF({
# plot(dat,xlab="dimension 1",ylab="dimension 2",main=paste("step",count))
# count<-count+1
# while(delta>0.00001){
#   plot(dat,xlab="dimension 1",ylab="dimension 2",main=paste("step",count))
#   count<-count+1
#   points(centroids,pch=4,col=1:3,cex=2,lwd=2)
#   d <- as.matrix(dist(rbind(centroids,dat)))
#   d <- d[-c(1:3),1:3]
#   group<-apply(d,1,which.min)  
#   points(dat,bg=group,pch=21,)
#   newcentroids <- t(sapply(splitit(group),function(ind) 
#     colMeans(dat[ind,,drop=FALSE])))
#   delta<-mean((centroids-newcentroids)^2)
#   centroids<-newcentroids
#   }
# },'kmeans.gif', interval = 0.5)

```


## How variability messes up clustering

Just like other summary statistics we have studied, the dendrogam and clusters are random variables. Random variability affects them. Because they are not univariate summaries, such as the t-statistic, reporting the associated uncertainty is not straightforwrd and rarely done in papers. This can be dangerous as it gives the false impression of being deterministic. 

To see how susceptibel clustering is to randomness we construct a simple simulation. Four groups with different expression profiles in 50 genes will be generated. To immitate a microarray we will then add 20,000 genes that are not differentially epxressed and are randomely varying. We create 10 samples from each profile.

```{r}
N1=50
profile <- matrix(rep(seq(1,4,len=N1),4),nrow=N1)
profile <- apply(profile,2,sample) ##make them different
set.seed(1)
dat <- sapply(0:39,function(i)
  profile[,floor(i/10)+1] + matrix(rnorm(N1,0,0.5),nrow=N1))
group <- rep(1:4,each=10)
d <- dist(t(dat))
plot(hclust(d),labels=group,main="",sub="",xlab="")
```

Now add 20,000 genes that are not differentially expressed


```{r}
N2=20000
dat2 <- rbind(dat,matrix(rnorm(N2*40,0,0.5),nrow=N2))
d <- dist(t(dat2))
plot(hclust(d),labels=group,main="",sub="",xlab="")
```



## Show the batch effect 

```{r}
twotissues <- c("hippocampus","cerebellum")
ind <- which(tissue%in%twotissues)
d <- dist(t(e[,ind]))
mds <- cmdscale(d)
cols=as.fumeric(tissue[ind])
plot(mds,col=cols,pch=cols+14)
legend("bottomright",twotissues,col=1:2,pch=15:16)
```

```{r}
study<- factor(tab[ind,3])
plot(mds,col=as.numeric(study)+2,pch=14+as.fumeric(tissue[ind]))
legend("bottomright",levels(study),col=1:5+2,pch=16,)
legend("topright",twotissues,pch=15:16)
```

```{r}
ind <- which(tissue=="cerebellum" & tab[,3]%in%c("GSE3790","GSE12907"))
tt<-genefilter::rowttests(e[,ind],factor(tab[ind,3]))
hist(tt$p.value,main="",ylab="p-value")
```
