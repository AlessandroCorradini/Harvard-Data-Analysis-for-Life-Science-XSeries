There are many interesting approaches to visualizing genome-scale data.
Two major packages in Bioconductor are Gviz and ggbio.  Both represent
significant efforts at bridging the gap between graphics facilities
and various genomic data structures.

ggbio's `autoplot` method can be very useful for broad overviews.
For a GRanges instance, each range for which data exists can be
depicted as a band on the chromosome.  The karyogram layout
gives a genome-wide view, but it can be important to control
the handling of extra-chromosomal sequence levels.

```{r getl,echo=FALSE,results="hide"}
suppressWarnings({
suppressPackageStartupMessages({
library(ERBS)
library(GenomeInfoDb)
library(ggbio)
})
})
```

Here is the layout for the liver cell line:
```{r lkd, fig=TRUE}
library(ERBS)
data(HepG2)
library(GenomeInfoDb)  # trim all but autosomal chroms
HepG2 = keepStandardChromosomes(HepG2)
data(GM12878)
GM12878 = keepStandardChromosomes(GM12878)
library(ggbio)
autoplot(HepG2, layout="karyogram", main="ESRRA binding on HepG2")
```

And for the B-cell line:

```{r lkm,fig=TRUE}
autoplot(GM12878, layout="karyogram", main="ESRRA binding on GM12878")
```
