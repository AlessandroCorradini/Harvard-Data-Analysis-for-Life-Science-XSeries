# Introduction

In the data management overview, we applied `summarizeOverlaps` to
the set of BAM files in RNAseqData.HNRNPC.bam.chr14.  Let's do it
again to focus on the object that is returned.

## BAM files to SummarizedExperiment for a single region

```{r dosumm, cache=TRUE}
library(RNAseqData.HNRNPC.bam.chr14)
bfp = RNAseqData.HNRNPC.bam.chr14_BAMFILES
library(Rsamtools)
bfl = BamFileList(file=bfp)
hnrnpcLoc = GRanges("chr14", IRanges(21677296, 21737638))
library(GenomicAlignments)
library(BiocParallel)
register(SerialParam())
hnse = summarizeOverlaps(hnrnpcLoc,bfl)
hnse
```

`hnse` is an instance of `r class(hnse)`.  This class is like
an ExpressionSet but has more facilities (and more modern
facilities) for managing assay summaries and metadata.
A visual schematic follows:

```{r lkseee,fig=TRUE,echo=FALSE}
library(ph525x)
summex()
```

Effective use of SummarizedExperiment instances involves learning
about methods that have been defined for them.
In order to get at the read/region overlap counts for HNRNPC, we apply
the `assay` method:
```{r lkcounts}
assay(hnse)
```
This is a bare-bones representation of the result.  The sample
identifiers have been propagated to column names of the matrix
of counts, but information on the region examined is lost in
this display.

## Metadata opportunities in the SummarizedExperiment

The `hnse` object has a little more information.
```{r lkrr}
rowRanges(hnse)
seqinfo(hnse)
metadata(hnse)
```
We can do better.  We will set up the analysis differently
so that the output is more comprehensive and self-describing.
# Making SummarizedExperiment more effective by enriching the inputs to summarizing methods

## Defining regions of interest, with metadata

We have seen that it is sufficient to define a single GRanges
to drive `summarizeOverlaps` over a set of BAM files.  We'd
like to preserve more metadata about the regions examined.
We'll use the TxDb infrastructure, to be described in more detail
later, to get a structure defining gene regions on chr14.
We'll also use the Homo.sapiens annotation package to add
gene symbols.
```{r getr}
library(TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19.knownGene)
txdb = TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19.knownGene
seqlevels(txdb) = "chr14"
gr14 = genes(txdb)
gr14$symbol = mapIds(Homo.sapiens, keys=gr14$gene_id, keytype="ENTREZID",
   column="SYMBOL")
gr14
```

## Defining the sample characteristics for the BAM files

We have three distinct preparations, one for control and two for knockdown.
We will use the GenomicFiles infrastructure to bind the sample level
metadata.
```{r setupcol}
char = rep(c("hela_wt", "hela_hkd"), each=4)
bff = GenomicFiles(files=path(bfl))
colData(bff)$condition = char
sid = c(1,1,1,1,2,2,3,3)
bff$sample = sid
bff
```

## Comparing read overlaps, preserving metadata

We'll look at 5 genes, including HNRNPC.  After computing, we
bind the sample-level data back into the result.
```{r redo,cache=TRUE}
hnse = summarizeOverlaps(gr14[c(1:4,305)],files(bff))
colData(hnse) = cbind(colData(hnse), colData(bff))
hnse
assay(hnse)
```
Note that row identifiers are now present with the count matrix.

A simple sanity check:
```{r lkbo,fig=TRUE}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
for (i in 2:5) {
  boxplot(assay(hnse)[i,]~hnse$condition, ylab=rowRanges(hnse)$symbol[i])
}
```

# Converting from ExpressionSet

This is easy, but more work will be needed to allow
subsetting of array probes based on genomic range queries.
```{r lknse}
library(ALL)
data(ALL)
allse = makeSummarizedExperimentFromExpressionSet(ALL)
allse
rowRanges(allse)
```

# Summary

The RangedSummarizedExperiment class instantiates some of the key
principles of Bioconductor data structure design:

* Assay data and metadata on sample characteristics (colData) are bound together in a coordinated way
* Matrix-like subsetting works directly on both assay and sample data
* Range-based subsetting works for assay components addressible by genomic coordinates
* Arbitrary metadata on assay features can be provided in the mcols(rowRanges(se))
* Arbitrary general metadata can be provided through `metadata(se)<-`
 
We'll learn more about adaptations of SummarizedExperiment to perform
specifically for multistage processing and analysis of RNA-seq experiments later in the course.
